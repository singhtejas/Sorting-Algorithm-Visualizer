**Sorting Algorithms** rearrange given arrays or elements within lists in a particular order. The purpose of this project is to show the visualization of these sorting algorithms. The sorting algorithms used in this project are **Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

**Merge Sort** is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the arrays into two halves and then recursively calls itself to split into two more halves until a single element is left. It then merges the sorted halves till all elements are in one array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n* Log n) because it takes linear time to merge the two halves. **Bubble Sort**, on the other hand, is one of the simplest algorithms that sorts the array by swapping adjacent elements placed in the wrong order. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2). 

The other sorting algorithms demonstrated in this program are Insertion Sort and Selection Sort. **Insertion Sort** is a sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time. The array elements are compared, and with each iteration, the smallest value is placed at the correct position in the sorted array.  Similarly, **Selection Sort** builds its array one element at a time by placing the smallest element at the beginning of the array. The time complexity of both Insertion Sort and Selection Sort is O(n^2).

**This project shows the visualization of these sorting algorithms.**
